# Namaste-React - Day 01

This repository contains the first-day learning notes and code examples for React. The focus is on using React with a CDN, understanding basic concepts like creating React elements, and using the `render()` method.

## Overview

### What you will learn:
1. How to include React via CDN.
2. The concept of **Cross-Origin**.
3. How to create a **Root element** where React will render.
4. Understanding `React.createElement()` and its role.
5. How to use the `render()` method in React.

### CDN for React

On Day 1, we start by including React and ReactDOM using CDN links. This allows you to use React without having to install anything.
